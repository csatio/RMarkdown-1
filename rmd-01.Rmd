## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
marvel_dc <- read.csv(file = 'dc-wikia-data.csv', stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
#knitr::kable(marvel_dc)
top10 <- tbl_df(marvel_dc) %>%
  group_by(APPEARANCES) %>%
  top_n(10)
knitr::kable(top10)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
